> Let's get some insights. And it's fine to be a data junky.

## Why
<!-- Why -->

_sammler_ is my attempt to bring business life, social activities and IoT together.

As I am fully adopting cloud in my private life, but I hate it that I don't have all the data available at a fingertip to be able to analyze them. 
Furthermore I am fully adopting IoT, collecting already more than 1GB each week.

So I need a solution to constantly collect and analyze all the data.

The ultimate goal would be:

- Analyze activities in the three different areas
- Be able to have access and analyze the full history in all areas

**But, wait ...**
There is also another reason for _sammler_. As I am constantly testing new architectural and technical approaches, I just need a playground to test and validate technologies.

## Principles
<!-- Principles -->
- Everything is Open Sourced.
- Follow a Readme Driven Development.
    - Publish everything: my progress, failure, thoughts, decisions.  
    (Will be fun in a year from now to especially read all the silly decisions ;-))
- Use as much existing solutions as possible, focus on assembling.
- All activities should be continuously tested and deployed to the cloud.
- The entire solution needs to multi-tenant enabled.
- Embrace the concept of microservices.
- Automate, automate, automate.

## Technology Choices
<!-- Technology Choices -->
From the beginning I have made some assumptions and technology choices. This is fine for now, but over time this might change:

- Programming languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, GoLang
- UI framework: AngularJS 2.0
- Containerization: Docker

All other decisions will be documented over time.

## Contributing
Primarily I do - especially at the beginning and in the next months - not expect any participation.
I might pretty slowly progress on this project, as this is just a private project, only working on it in my free time.

But stop: You might have similar requirements and interest, so pleas do not hesitate to [drop me a line](https://github.com/sammler/sammler/issues) and add your thoughts.
Certainly any contribution is highly appreciated.
