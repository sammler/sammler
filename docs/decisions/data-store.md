I decided to go with PostgreSQL as a data-store for the first services.

## Reasoning

- I very much like the combination of a relational database and a document store [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) introduced with version 9
- PostgreSql is pretty cheap to get in the cloud
- There are plenty of admin tools (I decided to go with [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) )
