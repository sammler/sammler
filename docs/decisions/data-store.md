I decided to go with Postgres as a data-store for all services.

## Reasoning

- I very much like the combination of a relational database and a document store Postgres introduced with version 9
- Postgres is pretty cheap to rent in the cloud
- There are plenty of admin tools (I decided to go with pgAdmin)
