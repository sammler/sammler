<!-- Principles -->
- Everything is Open Sourced.
- Follow a Readme Driven Development.
    - Publish everything: my progress, failure, thoughts, decisions.  
    (Will be fun in a year from now to especially read all the silly decisions ;-))
- Use as much existing solutions as possible, focus on assembling.
- All activities should be continuously tested and deployed to the cloud.
- The entire solution needs to multi-tenant enabled.
- Embrace the concept of microservices.
- Don't introduce any dependencies on Cloud providers such as Amazon.
- Automate, automate, automate.
