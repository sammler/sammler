Primarily I do - especially at the beginning and in the next months - not expect any contributions, and that's fine.  
I might pretty slowly progress on this project, as this is just a private project, only working on it in my free time.

But stop: You might have similar requirements and interest, so please do not hesitate to [drop me a line](https://github.com/sammler/sammler/issues) and add your thoughts.  
Even if you do not want to actively participate, I am very interested in listening to your opinion and your related requirements.  

Certainly any contribution is highly appreciated and will for sure encourage me to even work harder on this project.

Let's see, keep fingers crossed, I am curious, too, where this project finally ends up.
