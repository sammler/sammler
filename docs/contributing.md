Primarily I do - especially at the beginning and in the next months - not expect any participation.
I might pretty slowly progress on this project, as this is just a private project, only working on it in my free time.

But stop: You might have similar requirements and interest, so please do not hesitate to [drop me a line](https://github.com/sammler/sammler/issues) and add your thoughts.
Certainly any contribution is highly appreciated and will for sure encourage me to even work harder on this project.
