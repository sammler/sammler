<!-- Technology Choices -->

Some opinionated assumptions and technology choices have been made. But this might change over time.

- Programming languages: JavaScript / TypeScript, GoLang
- UI framework: Angular (Angular 2/4, not AngularJS)
- Storage: MongoDB
- Messaging: RabbitMQ
- Containerization: Docker
- Service orchestration: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes

All other decisions will be documented over time.
