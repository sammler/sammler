<!-- Why -->

_sammler_ is my attempt to bring business life, social activities and IoT together.

As I am fully adopting cloud in my private life, but I hate it that I don't have all the data available at a fingertip to be able to analyze them. 
Furthermore I am fully adopting IoT, collecting already more than 1GB each week.

So I need a solution to constantly collect and analyze all the data.

The ultimate goal would be:

- Analyze activities in the three different areas (business life, social activities, IoT)
- Create a pluggable system, so that it can be easily extended (by myself and certainly others)
- Be able to have access and analyze the full history in all areas

**But, wait ...**
There is also another reason for _sammler_:
As I am constantly testing new architectural and technical approaches, I just need a playground to test and validate technologies.
The entire setup of _sammler_ is also my reference implementation of a microservices based architecture, using some of the cutting edge solutions out there.

Finally, don't take the entire project too seriously, read here why: [It's the future](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/)
