<!-- Why -->

_sammler_ is my attempt to bring business life, social activities and IoT together.

As I am fully adopting cloud in my private life, but I hate it that I don't have all the data available at a fingertip to be able to analyze them. 
Furthermore I am fully adopting IoT, collecting already more than 1GB each week.

So I need a solution to constantly collect and analyze all the data.

The ultimate goal would be:

- Analyze activities in the three different areas
- Be able to have access and analyze the full history in all areas

**But, wait ...**
There is also another reason for _sammler_. As I am constantly testing new architectural and technical approaches, I just need a playground to test and validate technologies.
